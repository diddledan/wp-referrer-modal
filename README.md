Plugin Name: WP Referrer Modal

Plugin URI:  https://github.com/sterndata/wp-referrer-modal

Description: warn about follow homes from wordpress.org

Tests to see if the access is coming from a link on WordPress.org and, if so, fires a modal dialog showing the text
in the main plugin file.

Note: Text is currently stored as a wp_option but I have not yet put in the code to enter/edit it.  If you grab this plugin now, be sure to edit the file before you use the plugin for the first time.

Yeah, it's on the to-do list :-)
